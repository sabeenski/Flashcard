# Flashcard App 
We implemented and executed our codes by focusing our learnings about Document Object Model(DOM).
A simple app that allows users to learn about DOM and CSS with the help of flashcards. 
Users can click on the flashcard to see the answer and click 'next' button to check new question.
Users can also add new categories to the app.
Open <Homepage.html> in your browser to see the full app.
